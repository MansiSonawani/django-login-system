As of May 30 2022 google has removed the less secure apps option. There is no way to turn this on as it no longer exists. Enable 2fa on your google account and create an apps password and use that in place of your true password in your code

How to use it
Open the “Mail” app.
Open the “Settings” menu.
Select “Accounts” and then select your Google Account.
Replace your password with the 16-character password shown above.
Just like your normal password, this app password grants complete access to your Google Account. You won't need to remember it, so don't write it down or share it with anyone.
